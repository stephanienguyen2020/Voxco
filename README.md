Introduction
VoxcoPyAuto is a Python-based automation tool designed specifically to streamline the survey data collection process for the Poverty Tracker study conducted by the Center on Poverty & Social Policy at Columbia University. This project is part of a partnership with Robin Hood and Columbia University, aimed at understanding the dynamics of poverty, hardship, and disadvantage in New York City.

Background
The Poverty Tracker is a critical initiative that follows a panel of approximately 2,000 to 3,000 New York City households, surveying them every three months over several years. This approach enables the collection of detailed and longitudinal data on income, material hardships, health, and well-being, thereby providing insights into the evolving nature of disadvantage in the city.

As a Research Assistant involved in this project, I encountered a significant challenge during my daily tasks, which involved making 40 to 60 calls to survey participants. The predominant issue was that about 90% of these calls ended up in voicemail, especially during daytime shifts. Recognizing this pattern, I identified an opportunity to optimize the process using automation.

The Solution: VoxcoPyAuto
To address this challenge, I developed VoxcoPyAuto using Python and PyAutoGUI. This script is tailored to automatically mark calls that reach voicemail without a message (denoted as 'MACH' in Voxco) as complete. This automation significantly reduces the manual effort required in the survey process and increases efficiency in data collection.

Features
Automated Call Marking: Automatically marks calls as 'MACH' in Voxco when they reach voicemail without requiring a message.
User-Friendly: Easy to set up and use, requiring minimal technical expertise.
Efficiency Boost: Reduces manual effort, allowing more focus on other critical aspects of the study.
Installation
To use VoxcoPyAuto, you will need Python installed on your system along with PyAutoGUI. Detailed instructions on installation and setup are provided in the accompanying documentation.

Usage
Instructions on how to run and customize VoxcoPyAuto for your specific needs are included in the documentation.
